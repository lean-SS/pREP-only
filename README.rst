Background: The idea of pREPonly (or "pepperoni" when pronounced fast) was fructified 
during the Orang Asli community A. baumannii study. pREPonly was initially written to 
facilitate screening of A. baumannii plasmid Rep types of my samples, based on the 
classification from AcinetobacterPlasmidTyping database. As the AcinetobacterPlasmidTyping 
database contained only lists of accession numbers to the respective Rep-types, it can be 
laborious to go through and collect all of them. Thus, I took some initiative in my free
time to download and sort them, then turn them into BLAST database - in hope for the 
AcinetobacterPlasmidTyping database to be more easily accessible to users, as well as in
the attempt to help centralise plasmid classification. 

Thank you for spending time to read this (if you did).
